  # Spanner PostgreSQL follows the ORDER BY rules for NULL values of PostgreSQL. This means

  # 1. NULL values are ordered last by default when a query result is ordered in ascending
  #    order.
  # 2. NULL values are ordered first by default when a query result is ordered in descending
  #    order.
  # 3. NULL values can be ordered first or last by specifying NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST in the
  #    ORDER BY clause.
