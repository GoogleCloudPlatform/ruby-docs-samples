# Authenticate Users with IAP

* A short App Engine app, which uses [Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/) to serve a webpage which says `"Hello #{user_email_address}"`, where `user_email_address` is the authenticated user's email address.
* To run, follow Ruby's [Authenticating Users with IAP](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/getting-started/authenticate-users-with-iap) tutorial.
